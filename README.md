# Horton
Volunteer management, coordination, and communication.

# Inspiration
As a member of the community service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega, I was inspired to meaningfully inspire, mentor, and help others through service and volunteering. The motto of our fraternity is _αργη φιλια ψφελια_: _Be a leader, be a friend, be of service_. Horton, named after one of the founders of Alpha Phi Omega, is my biggest way of giving back to the world of volunteering and service, and as a gift to the brothers of Alpha Phi Omega (especially those in the Gamma Chapter at Cornell!)
